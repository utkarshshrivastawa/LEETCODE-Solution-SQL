Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:
| Field  | Type          |
|--------|---------------|
| ID     | NUMBER        |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21)  |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)   |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER        |
| LONG_W | NUMBER        |

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

CODE : 

SELECT ROUND((MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N) + MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W)), 4) AS D
FROM STATION
